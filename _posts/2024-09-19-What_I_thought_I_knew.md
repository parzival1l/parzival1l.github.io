description: Late night thoughts about where I am in my career.

I turned in my submission for the Cohere Research Scholar Program at 1:57 AM on a early monday morning (3 minutes before the deadline I say). The code I wrote was in shambles, simply put this is not the kind of codes I want to be remembered by, not my best work. But to be fair, the questions were difficult for someone of my caliber to understand. It led me to take a hard look at myself, and want kind of AI engineer, although this was not a job present at the turn of decade, let alone century. People are still trying to struggling to figure how to succeed in this space of AI, ML, LLMs etc.. and I more than others.
