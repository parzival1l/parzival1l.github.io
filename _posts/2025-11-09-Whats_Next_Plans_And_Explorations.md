I recently wrapped up my thesis, and as I close this chapter, I'm excited to share what's on the horizon. This post outlines my plans for learning, building, and growing in the coming months.

## Publishing the Research

First things first: I want to see my thesis work make an impact beyond my university. My immediate goal is to identify a suitable conference and work toward getting my paper published. The research deserves to be part of the broader academic conversation, and I'm looking forward to the feedback and connections that come with conference participation.

Preprint available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17720)
## Back to Fundamentals

While I have a board full of ambitious project ideas, I'm taking a different approach for now. Instead of chasing the next big thing, I want to focus on strengthening my fundamentals. This means:

- Working on smaller projects that might not serve an immediate "purpose"
- Following structured courses when they help solidify concepts
- Embracing project-based learning, even if it means building something that already exists

Sometimes the best way forward is to slow down and build a stronger foundation.

## Making Use of What I Have

I have several resources sitting idle that I plan to put to good use:

- **Azure credits** - [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
- **LLM fine-tuning course credits** - [Maven Course](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/fine-tuning)
- Other accumulated learning resources

It's time to stop letting these expire and start experimenting with them.

## Competitive Coding & Challenges

I also want to get back into active coding through platforms like:

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Yes, AI can solve most of these problems now. But the point isn't just getting the right answer—it's about training my own thinking, pattern recognition, and problem-solving skills. There's value in the struggle.

## Learning Resources (A Rolling List)

This is a living list that I'll update as I work through materials and discover new ones:

### Books

## Final Thoughts

This isn't about having a perfect plan or following a strict schedule. It's about staying curious, building consistently, and learning in public. Some of these projects will lead somewhere; others will just be learning experiences. Both outcomes are valuable.

I'll update this post periodically as I make progress and discover new resources worth sharing.
